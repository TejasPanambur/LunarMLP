# Tejas Panambur - CVPR 2025 Landing Page

## A Foundational Multimodal Model for Lunar Surface Correlation Discovery

This landing page showcases the groundbreaking research conducted at NASA's Frontier Development Lab, focusing on using advanced machine learning techniques to understand lunar surface hydration patterns.

### 🌙 Project Overview

This work presents the first application of the Massively Multimodal Masked Model (4M) framework to planetary hyperspectral data, specifically analyzing lunar surface composition and hydration patterns using NASA's Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M³) dataset.

### 🔬 Key Research Contributions

- **First Lunar Foundation Model**: Developed specialized tokenizers for hyperspectral, mineralogical, and elemental data
- **Automated Co-registration**: Implemented OmniGlue + RANSAC for precise image alignment
- **Novel Correlations**: Discovered strong correlations between:
  - Morning hydration patterns and pyroxene abundance
  - Midday dehydration and titanium content

### 📊 Technical Highlights

- **Data Coverage**: 95% of lunar surface analyzed
- **Spectral Range**: 85 channels from 0.446 to 3 μm
- **Training Scale**: 1.5M samples (128×128 patches)
- **Infrastructure**: Google Cloud with GPU acceleration

### 🏆 Recognition

This research was conducted as part of the prestigious Frontier Development Lab program, a collaboration between NASA, SETI Institute, and leading technology companies including Google Cloud, NVIDIA, and Lockheed Martin.
